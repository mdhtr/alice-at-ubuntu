#Automatization of "scanimage" to create sequentially numbered output.

#Standard use of scanimage:
#scanimage -x 100 -y 100 --mode Lineart --filename /home/agi/SCAN/file.pnm
#
#$date=`date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S` # i.e. 20121201184522
#scanimage -x $x -y $y --mode $mode --filename $HOME/SCAN/$date.pnm

#what this program has to do:
#DONE# ask for document details: scan area, scan mode
#have a standard scan location ie /home/user/scan -- now scans to script directory.
#DONE# ask for permission to scan before each scan, and have option to 
#DONE# give sequentially growing filenames to scanned files.
#DONE# actually this could be the precise date and time. it is not possible to scan 2 docs within the same second.

######NEW IDEAS#####
#change color mode
#return to beginning to change page size and choose color mode
#when lineart be able to set threshold 45 for darker paper
